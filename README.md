# Food Truck Project

## Week 2 Homework

## Overview

Food Truck
* Make a program that makes the user input a food truck's name, food type, and rating
* Use code to assign a unique ID to the food trucks that the user has inputed with each new iteration
* Have the program continue to operate until the user exits the program
* Program MUST be able to successfully run all required tasks in instructions to receive full credit 


## Technologies/Skills

* Java
* Eclipse
* Github
* Arrays
* While loops
* Getters/Setters
* Constructors
* Methods


## Lessons Learned

* Improved on using the While loop in order to set user input for food truck information, then to be able to break into another While loop for user to inquire about certain information

* Obtained more experience in using different classes, conductors, and getters/setters. Will need to continue to use more in future projects to get a better understanding

* Improved use of Methods with use of parameters. Will need to include more into future projects to get better experience in using Methods instead of writing everything in Main.

* Utilized Arrays for the first time in a large project. Will need to review more on material to gather better understanding

* OVERALL: Project more difficult than last weeks project. Needed more assistance for certain parts of the program. Will need to review more material and start on smaller, similar projects when able
